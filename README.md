# 🌟 Oluwayemi Oyinlola Michael – Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to the repository of my **personal portfolio website**, a custom-built project showcasing my skills, experience, personality, and journey into the tech world. This website was designed and developed using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** — no frameworks or templates — to reflect my commitment to learning the fundamentals of front-end development and design.

## 👋🏽 About Me

I'm **Oluwayemi Oyinlola Michael**, a self-taught **front-end developer** and an aspiring **cybersecurity specialist** from **Okitipupa, Ondo State, Nigeria**. With a passion for solving real-world problems through technology, I’ve dedicated myself to mastering the digital skills that drive today’s innovation.

I may not come from a traditional tech background, but that hasn’t stopped me. After leaving university, I doubled down on self-education, online learning, and hands-on building. This portfolio represents not just what I can do — but who I’m becoming.
