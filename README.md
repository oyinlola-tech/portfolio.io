2. Open `index.html` in your browser, or serve the folder to avoid any asset restrictions.

Examples (PowerShell):

```powershell
# Python 3 builtin server (recommended):

## Project structure

```text
portfolio.io/
├── index.html         # Main page
├── css/
│   └── style.css      # All styles
├── js/
│   └── script.js      # Page scripts
├── images/            # (optional) profile and project images
└── README.md          # This file
```

Notes: your project files may be in slightly different paths (e.g. `oyin.jpg` lives in the repo root).

---

## Edit tips

- Hero image: replace `oyin.jpg` in the project root with a new image (keep the same filename or update `index.html`).
- Content: edit `index.html` to change text, add projects, or update contact links.
- Styles: update `css/style.css` to tweak colors, spacing, and responsive breakpoints.
- JS: `js/script.js` handles simple behaviors (nav toggle, skill bar animation, tilt effect).

---

## Accessibility and performance

- Keep headings semantic and images with `alt` text for accessibility.
- Optimize images (resize and compress) to improve load speed.

## 👋🏽 About Me

I'm **Oluwayemi Oyinlola Michael**, a self-taught **front-end developer** and an aspiring **cybersecurity specialist** from **Okitipupa, Ondo State, Nigeria**. With a passion for solving real-world problems through technology, I’ve dedicated myself to mastering the digital skills that drive today’s innovation.

I may not come from a traditional tech background, but that hasn’t stopped me. After leaving university, I doubled down on self-education, online learning, and hands-on building. This portfolio represents not just what I can do — but who I’m becoming.
