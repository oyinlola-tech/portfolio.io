    <article class="article-content">
      <p>Formative assessment is day-to-day checking used to guide instruction. Summative assessment measures what students know at a point in time. Both are essential, but formative assessment is the engine that prevents surprises on summative moments.</p>

      <h3>Examples</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Formative:</strong> exit tickets, quick quizzes, think-pair-share, whiteboard checks.</li>
        <li><strong>Summative:</strong> end-of-unit tests, final projects, standardized exams.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why formative assessment matters</h3>
      <p>Frequent, low-stakes checks let teachers adjust pacing, reteach concepts, and personalize support. They make learning visible and reduce anxiety about big tests.</p>

      <h3>Practical formative strategies</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use 3-question exit tickets focused on one learning goal.</li>
        <li>Do quick retrieval practice at the start of class (5 minutes).</li>
        <li>Give immediate, specific feedback (what to fix and how).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Designing summative assessments</h3>
      <p>Align your summative tasks with standards and the formative work students have practiced. Include rubrics and exemplars so expectations are clear.</p>

      <h3>Takeaway</h3>
      <p>Think of formative assessment as coaching and summative as the match. Coach well and students perform better when it matters.</p>
