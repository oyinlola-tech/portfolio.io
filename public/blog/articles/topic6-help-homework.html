      <h2>How to Help Your Child with Homework Without Doing It For Them</h2>
      <p class="article-meta muted">Practical scripts, routines and boundaries that let parents guide rather than solve.</p>
    </section>

    <article class="article-content">
      <p>Helping with homework is a balancing act: you want your child to succeed, but you also want them to develop ownership and confidence. The goal is to coach, scaffold and model strategies — not to provide answers.</p>

      <h3>Start with routine</h3>
      <p>Build a predictable homework routine: same place, same time, short warm-up task (5 minutes), and a clear finishing ritual (put materials away, one sentence reflection).</p>

      <h3>Use guiding questions (scripts that work)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>"What do you think the first step could be?"</li>
        <li>"Show me where you got stuck — what part is confusing?"</li>
        <li>"What have you tried so far?"</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Teach 1–2 strategies, not the answer</h3>
      <p>Model a strategy (like breaking a word into syllables, or drawing a diagram), then step back and say, “Now you try with the same steps.”</p>

      <h3>Encourage reflection & independence</h3>
      <p>At the end of the session, ask: "What helped you most today?" and "What will you do first next time?" This builds metacognition and planning skills.</p>

      <h3>When it's appropriate to step in</h3>
      <p>If your child is stuck after trying and is anxious, offer a small hint or scaffold. If they repeatedly avoid work, focus on routines and motivation rather than doing the homework yourself.</p>

      <h3>Support for different ages</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Primary (5–8):</strong> Provide structure and short, concrete instructions.</li>
        <li><strong>Upper primary (9–12):</strong> Teach planning: break tasks into steps and set mini-deadlines.</li>
        <li><strong>Teens:</strong> Focus on independence, offer to review drafts and give feedback, not rewrite.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>Be the coach, not the doer. With consistent routines, guiding language, and small strategy-teaching moments, children develop the skills to solve problems on their own — and that’s the real win.</p>
