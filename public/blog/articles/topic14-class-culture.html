    <article class="article-content">
      <p>Class culture is the collection of routines, values, and interactions that shape daily life. Strong culture makes learning safer and more joyful for everyone.</p>

      <h3>First-week priorities</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Co-create norms with students so they own the rules.</li>
        <li>Use team-building tasks that reveal strengths and promote trust.</li>
        <li>Introduce classroom rituals (morning check-ins, exit reflections).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Small daily habits that matter</h3>
      <p>Consistency beats grand gestures. Use routines for transitions, quick feedback, and visible celebrations of effort.</p>

      <h3>Address conflict constructively</h3>
      <p>Teach problem-solving scripts and restorative questions: “What happened? Who was affected? What will you do to make it better?”</p>

      <h3>Communicate with families</h3>
      <p>Share classroom norms and highlight student successes. Family partnerships strengthen culture beyond the school walls.</p>

      <h3>Takeaway</h3>
      <p>Invest daily in small, predictable rituals and clear expectations. Culture grows slowly but pays major dividends for focus and belonging.</p>
